# live-neat
A rtNEAT neuroevolution engine written in typescript. While it functions offline, the goal was to make a distributed, embeddable solution. Thus this project is incomplete.

### notes
* the _true_ core data structure is the connection gene
* maybe this could be broken down further into a framework for genetic algorithms and NEAT

```typescript
Array<Connection> <=> InnovationMap<Connection>
```
